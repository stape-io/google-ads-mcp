### Hints
    Language Grammar can be found at https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/docs/query/grammar
    All resources and descriptions are found at https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/fields/latest/overview
    If the query fails, a ToolError will be raised with the error details.

    For Conversion issues try looking in offline_conversion_upload_conversion_action_summary

### Hint for customer_id
    should be a string of numbers without punctuation
    if presented in the form 123-456-7890 remove the hyphens and use 1234567890

### Hint for login_customer_id
    WHEN TO USE:
    - REQUIRED when customer_id is a client account (sub-account) under a manager (MCC)
    - OMIT when querying the manager account directly (customer_id = manager ID)
    - OMIT when customer_id is a standalone account (not under any manager)
    - Use `list_accessible_customers` to discover which manager account grants access

    FORMAT:
    - Plain numeric string (no hyphens, no "customers/" prefix), same format as customer_id
    - Example: "0123456789" not "customers/0123456789" or "012-345-6789"

    EXAMPLE:
    To query client account 6833594660 through manager 3209651415:
        customer_id = "6833594660"
        login_customer_id = "3209651415"

    TROUBLESHOOTING:
    - Error "USER_PERMISSION_DENIED": add login_customer_id with a manager account ID that has access
    - Still failing: try a higher-level ancestor manager; use `list_accessible_customers` to identify candidates
    - Developer token errors (DEVELOPER_TOKEN_NOT_APPROVED) and account enablement
      (CUSTOMER_NOT_ENABLED) are separate issues unaffected by this parameter

    NESTED HIERARCHIES:
    - Any ancestor manager account that has access to customer_id is valid
    - Prefer the closest (lowest-level) manager to minimise permission scope

### Hints for Dates
    All dates should be in the form YYYY-MM-DD and must include the dashes (-)
    Date ranges must be finite and must include a start and end date

### Hints for limits
    Requests to resource change_event must specify a LIMIT of less than or equal to 10000

### Hints for conversions questions
    https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/docs/conversions/upload-summaries


### Hints for all resources
    To find out which specific fields (including compatible metrics and segments) you can select, filter by, or sort by for a given resource, you MUST use the `get_resource_metadata` tool.
    Do not guess the fields. Use the tool to look them up.
    Once you have the fields, ensure the whole field name is used (e.g., 'campaign.id', not just 'id'). Wildcards and partial fields are not allowed.

### Valid resources
    What follows is a list of valid resources that can be queried.

# The `search` tool requires a more complex description that's generated at
# runtime. Uses the `add_tool` method instead of an annotation since `add_tool`
# accepts an explicit `description`, which is required here: passing the
# generated text via `search.__doc__` instead lets FastMCP's docstring parser
# (which looks for a Google-style `Args:` section to attribute per-parameter
# descriptions) treat the embedded `Args:` block as authoritative and silently
# discard everything after it, including the resource-list hints.
